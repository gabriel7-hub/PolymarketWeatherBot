"""Resolution-source fidelity audit.

The entire strategy rests on one assumption: the station daily-max we compute
from IEM ASOS METAR, rounded to whole °C, equals the number Polymarket actually
resolves on (Wunderground station obs). If those disagree by even ~1°C, every
modeled probability is aimed at the wrong target and all "edge" is noise.

This module measures that directly on RESOLVED markets: for each closed event it
reads the winning whole-degree from Polymarket, fetches our METAR daily max for
the same station/date, and compares. No waiting for our own trades to settle —
it runs on the public resolution history right now.
